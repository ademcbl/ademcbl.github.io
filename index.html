        <P>
        	1)  I have a project that I plan to do in the future. echetronic cigarettes with low nicotine content. 
        </P>

        <P>
        	2)  Aim: reduce smoking
        </P>
        <P>
        	3)  Target Audience: smokers
        </P>
        <P>
        	4)  Contribution: People will be more likely to reduce smoking as it will give smokers a feeling as if they are smoking without using nicotine.
        </P>
        <P>
        5)  Possible Risks: increased dependence on nicotine contrary to what was planned	
        </P>
        <P>
        	6)  Usage: It gives you the chance to smoke 20 times a day as if you are smoking a pack of cigarettes and makes you feel like you are meeting your nicotine needs.
In the future, the daily drinking limit is expected to be reduced and users are expected to adapt to this.
        </P>
